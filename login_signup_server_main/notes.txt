What is JWT?
----------------------
JwT is a secure token given by the server after login. 
This token is used to prove your identity when accessing protected APIs.

Think of JWT like an ID card:

login = get ID card

API request = show ID card

---------------------
why do we need JWT?

without JWT:
    server must remember every logged-in user
    not scalable

with JWT:
    Server doesnt store session
    client sends token every time
    fast and secure

used in MERN, REST APIs, mobile apps


JWT Expansion

    JWT=JSON Web token

JWT structure

    a JWT has 3 parts separated by dots:
        Header.payload.signature

exapmle:
ajfaldsjaowuauoisdufoajrouehuagnalhOHUOHRWOJOHootaojnrhw

Part Meaning:
Header --> token type & algorithm
payload --> user data
signature --> security lock

password is never stored in JWT

how JWT works(Flow)
login-> server creates JWT -> client stores JWT -> client sends JWT -> server verifies -> access allows

real-life scenario
    cinema exapmle
    buy ticked = login
    ticket = JWT
    show ticket = API request
